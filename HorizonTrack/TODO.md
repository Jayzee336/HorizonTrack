# TODO: Separate IN and OUT Entries in Live Attendance

## Tasks to Complete

- [ ] Modify `renderLiveAttendance` function in `script.js` to create separate containers for IN and OUT entries
- [ ] Filter today's attendance data into IN and OUT arrays, sort each by most recent time first
- [ ] Append IN entries to IN container and OUT entries to OUT container
- [ ] Update `astyles.css` to add styling for "Time In" and "Time Out" section headings and proper spacing
- [ ] Test the changes by launching the attendance page to verify the separation and layout

## Notes
- Ensure the sections are clearly distinguished with headings.
- Maintain the existing sorting by time (most recent first) within each section.
- Verify that the layout looks good and entries are properly spaced.
